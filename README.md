# Stock-market-prediction-with-machine-learning-project
Author - Reethu yadav 
Welcome to the Stock Market Prediction project! This repository contains a machine learning model to predict stock prices and a user-friendly web application built with Streamlit to interact with the model.

Features
Data Collection: Fetches historical stock price data from a reliable source.
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the data for training the machine learning model.
Model Training: Uses machine learning algorithms to predict future stock prices based on historical data.
Interactive Web App: A Streamlit-based web application to visualize stock data and interact with the prediction model.

Model Description
The machine learning model used in this project is a [mention the algorithm, e.g., LSTM, ARIMA, etc.] model. It has been trained on historical stock price data to predict future prices. The model includes the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and splitting the data into training and test sets.
Model Training: Training the model on the training set using [specific algorithm].
Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as MAE, RMSE, etc.
Web App Description
The Streamlit web application provides an interactive interface to:

Visualize Historical Data: Plot historical stock prices and trends.
Predict Future Prices: Input a stock symbol and get the predicted future prices.
Download Results: Download the predicted data for further analysis.
